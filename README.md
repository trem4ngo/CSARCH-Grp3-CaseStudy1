## 4. Compatibility Justification
For each part, explain compatibility and choices.   
- **CPU + Motherboard**: The Intel Core i5-12400F uses the LGA1700 socket, which is fully supported by the MSI PRO B760M-A WIFI DDR4 motherboard. This board is designed for Intel’s 12th and 13th Gen processors and comes with BIOS compatibility out of the box. It also supports DDR4 memory, aligning with the RAM choice.
- **RAM**: The build includes 2x Kingston Fury Beast 16GB DDR4-3600MHz modules, totaling 32GB. These are compatible with the motherboard’s DDR4 slots and run at an optimal speed for both gaming and multitasking. Dual-channel configuration ensures better memory bandwidth. 
- **GPU**: The INNO3D RTX 3060 12GB fits into the motherboard’s PCIe x16 slot and is supported by the MSI MAG A650BN 650W PSU, which provides sufficient wattage and the required 8-pin PCIe connectors. The SilverStone FARA R1 PRO ATX case has enough clearance for this GPU. 
- **Storage:**: The Samsung 980 1TB NVMe SSD connects via the motherboard’s M.2 PCIe Gen 3 slot, offering fast boot and load times. The Seagate Barracuda 2TB HDD uses a standard SATA port, also supported by the motherboard.
- **CPU Cooler:**: The Cooler Master H412R Spectrum is compatible with the LGA1700 socket and fits within the clearance of the FARA R1 PRO case, ensuring adequate cooling for the i5-12400F.
- **Case + PSU + Fans:**: The SilverStone FARA R1 PRO ATX case supports ATX and Micro-ATX motherboards, fitting the B760M perfectly. The MSI MAG A650BN PSU is ATX-sized and fits the case’s PSU bay. The Thermaltake ARGB 3-pack fans are 120mm and compatible with the case’s fan mounts and motherboard headers for RGB control.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱60,000  
- **Final Total**: ₱58,837  
- ✅ Within budget
- Notes on trade-offs (e.g., cheaper RAM, higher PSU wattage, no aftermarket cooler, etc.).
    - Chose DDR4 RAM instead of DDR5 to stay within budget while maintaining performance.
    - Selected a budget-friendly RGB cooler that fits the case and provides sufficient thermal control.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Reflections on:  
- Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)  
- Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents  
- What the group learned about PC components and system design 

Throughout this project, we gained valuable insights into the realities of building a PC within a fixed budget and local market constraints. One of the key takeaways was the noticeable price difference between international vendors and Manila-based suppliers—while overseas options sometimes offered lower prices, local sourcing provided faster delivery, warranty support, and ensured compatibility with region-specific components. We also faced challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents for popular parts like the RTX 3060 and certain motherboards, which led to strategic trade-offs such as choosing DDR4 RAM over DDR5 to stay within budget. Most importantly, we deepened our understanding of PC components and system design, learning how each part interacts with the others, how to balance performance with cost, and how to plan around real-world limitations like vendor availability and power requirements. This experience sharpened our technical decision-making and reinforced the importance of adaptability in building efficient, upgrade-ready systems.
